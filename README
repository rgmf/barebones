Here there are a set of barebones mini-projects. The goal is to learn Operating System, assembly and how hardware works.

The source I am using is wiki.osdev.org, a greate website that provides information about the creation of opearating system and serves as a comunity for those people intereseted in operating system creation with a lot of wiki articles.
