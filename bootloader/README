This bootloader loads the second sector from a floppy where a program is.

The test assembly files are simple bootloaders for practice.

I have used these sources:
* wiki.osdev.org
* https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/668422/Writing-a-boot-loader-in-Assembly-and-C-Part

WHAT BOOTLOADER DOES:
================================================================================
At this moment the bootloader does:
- Memory detection.
- Test A20 line and enabled it if needed.
- Loads the second floppy sector.
- Enters to protected mode.
- Jump to os.S code.

HOW TO USE:
================================================================================
You need bochs.

Then you can execute:
* make (to build).
* make bochs (to execute bochs VM).
